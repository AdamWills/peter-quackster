# Peter Quackster - Slackbot's silliest bot

So far, all this guy does is tell some awful jokes.

## How to get started...

1. Run `npm install`
2. Start the app with `token=INSERT_BOT_TOKEN node index.js`
3. Be amused.

## What Peter Quackster does

1. He can respond to someone saying hello to him
2. He can tell a joke. This can either be done by mentioning him and the word 'joke' (e.g. @peter.quackster - tell me a joke!) or by directly messaging him and mentioning 'joke'.
3. Sets reminders for daily standups and Wiretaps!
